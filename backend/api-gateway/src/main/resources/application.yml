    # NOTE: Since no Eureka server was listed in the architecture or docker-compose, I will assume basic Gateway routing via URLs or internal Docker DNS if they were in the same network.
    # HOWEVER, running LOCALLY (outside docker), we need to point to localhost ports.
    # Updating URIs to point to localhost for local development convenience as requested.
